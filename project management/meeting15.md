-looking into basic node environment variables and env files for backend server files
-finally got workout service and workoutModel to work on typescript front-end

Kenry
I changed the mobile layouts login/registration/initial goal pages and researched angular pir chart and chart.js
I will review other pages that our frontend just restyle to make sure everything is consistent.
I realized that we might need to re-think how we should implement navigation bar, because the functionality of the navigation bar is too hard to code right now.
