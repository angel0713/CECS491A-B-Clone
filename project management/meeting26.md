Meeting: [11/13/2023 @ 6:30ish PM; Days until Sprint # is due: 22  ]
-----
Summary:
Max- Looked into searching by a given field rather than ID; Figured it out; All categories will be used (may need to make a user preferences section (frontend/backend for registration))
Michael- Fixed registration (changed pages before typescript could run)
Angel- Sounds / notification page work on frontend 
Kenry- worked on workout information page (implemented calendar / chart; need recommendation)
Kevin- Absent
Karen- working on invite; only issue is that auto accept is implemented on all users; will need to figure out how to change that
Katherine- reading docs on sendbird on how to block users to avoid invitations from them / not see what they post
-----
Max
-struggled on trying to make a search by ID possible (on workout backend)
-Figured out what I was doing yesterday for the backend; will move on to updating the backend to include user ID to check for authentication and throw error if rejected 
-Preparing to move back home
Michael
Worked on calorie token stuff
Deleted the stuff I worked on yesterday since it was incorrect and fixed improper routing for registration
Knowledge on implementing this token verification.
Angel
What did you do yesterday? 
-Yesterday,  I worked on saving the mat-radio-button values from the sounds and notifications page.
What will you do today?
-Today, I will do some research on how to create a subscription service for the sounds and notifications page. 
What is blocking your progress? 
-The thing currently blocking my progress is I need a walkthrough of how the backend works so that the frontend team and I can start connecting our front end to the backend.
