What did you do yesterday? 
-Yesterday, I made the user-login-component the home component, I added most of the components to the navbar and I created a backStack to make the browser's back button work. I also worked on different components like, sounds-and-notifications, faq, etc..
What will you do today?
-Today, I will work on finishing more frontends of components. Tomorrow I will work on getting the browser's front button to work (just like the back button; likely just have to make a frontStack list).
What is blocking your progress? 
-The thing currently blocking my progress is time.
