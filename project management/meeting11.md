Summary:
Max- Looked into environment variables and how to implement into the backend and how to implement APIs into program; Prefer backend to frontend as I do not know much CSS
Michael- Thinking about what they wanted to work on for this sprint; specifically want to implement JWT tokens for backend to function
Angel- Research on angular material and bootstrap for frontend development; 3 Things wanted to be done: Standardize CSS to bootstrap, More component creation and finish the remaining components, Trying to dabble in backend()
Kenry- Working on the return function for the NavBar on the frontend; Research on bootstrap grid system
Kevin- Thinking about what they wanted to work on for this sprint; Decided that focus of work will be decided by what is needed for the sprint
Karen- Thinking about what they wanted to work on for this sprint; Wants to focus on sendbird with chat optimizing, message filters, admin privilages
Katherine- Sendbird research and tried the tutorial I sent based on sendbird; Error that needs to be corrected, will send later today

Max
- Researched environment variables and how to utilize APIs in our program 
- More research on how environment variables are hidden from abuse in our program despite being in the same project file
- Trying to figure out if keeping environment files within the project compromises security / functionality within the program
Michael
Still looking into JWT and how to implement it into our entire backend.
Want to figure out how JWT works and slowly work through that the entire week
Researching how to implement JWT into our backend smoothly
Angel
What did you do yesterday? 
-Yesterday, I researched some pros and cons between using angular material vs raw html & thinking about maybe implementing bootstrap grid for css
What will you do today?
-Today (or possibly tomorrow), I hope to choose a standardized html & css so Kenry and I can start standardizing all of the front-end components. 
What is blocking your progress? 
-The thing currently blocking my progress is studying for other classes.
