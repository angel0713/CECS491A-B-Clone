What is blocking your progress? 
-Work from other classes as well as understanding the codebase for workout and calories to integrate tokens effectively as well as this cold/COVID i caught

What did you do yesterday? 
-Yesterday,  I worked on updating some frontend html for the achievements component.
What will you do today?
-Today, I will work on the workout-entry-frontend html so that all of the options require the user to choose from  a dropdown instead of typing their own options. 
What is blocking your progress? 
-The thing currently blocking my progress is getting up to date on how the backend works for our project.
